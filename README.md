# PHP application starter with Docker

I was tired of having to copy these files around from project to project. So, here it is, a starter for your arbitrary php application.

## How does it work?

Well, first of all, magic. Secondly, it's the easiest thing you've ever done, after you installed the metric crap ton of required software.

I run OS X, which means I just installed Kitematic and it Just Worked (tm).

For Linux, [http://lmgtfy.com?q=install+docker+on+linux](click here)

For Windows, [http://lmgtfy.com?q=install+docker+on+windows](click here)

Done? Great! Let's gooooo.

`docker-compose build & docker-compose up -d`

## It's not running, what did I do wrong?

Well, if you're like me, you've probably encountered every error humanly possible.
In this situation I advice you to [make an issue](https://github.com/mitchellvanw/php-app-docker/issues/new) or spend countless hours in StackOverflow.
